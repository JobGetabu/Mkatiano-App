/**
 * Created by JOB on 2/22/2018.
 *
 * Additional text on this class
 * @layout is used to bind the layout with this class.
 * @View is used to bind the views in a layout we want to refer to.
 * @Resolve annotation bind a method to be executed when the view is ready to be used.
 * Any operation we want to perform on view references should be written in a method and annotated with this.
 * @SwipeOut calls the annotated method when the card has been rejected.
 * @SwipeIn calls the annotated method when the card has be accepted.
 * @SwipeCancelState calls the annotated method when the card is put back in the deck/canceled.
 * @SwipeInState pings the annotated method till the card is moving in accepted state.
 * @SwipeOutState pings the annotated method till the card is moving in rejected state.
 * IMPORTANT: If we donâ€™t plan to re add a view then the class should be annotated with
 * @NonReusable so that the references are released and memory is optimises.
 * For the demonstration, we are adding a view back in the deck
 * if rejected, so we have not used
 * @NonReusable.
